2.2 CD O
It PRP O
was VBD O
determined VBN O
that IN O
magnetic JJ O

undertaken JJ O
using VBG O
Geoscan JJ O

across IN O
the DT O

would MD O
be VB O
the DT O
most RBS O
effective JJ O
method NN O
of IN O
achieving VBG O
the DT O
first JJ O
objective NN O
. . O

Scanning VBG O
is VBZ O
particularly RB O
useful JJ O
as IN O
a DT O
means NN O
of IN O
rapidly RB O
identifying VBG O
areas NNS O
of IN O
archaeological JJ O
potential NN O
so IN O
that DT O
limited VBD O
detailed JJ O
survey NN O
can MD O
be VB O
focussed VBN O
to TO O
best VB O
effect NN O

2.3 CD O
Magnetic JJ O
scanning NN O
requires VBZ O
the DT O
operator NN O
to TO O
visually RB O
identify VB O
anomalous JJ O
responses NNS O
on IN O
the DT O
instrument NN O
display NN O
panel NN O
whilst NN O
covering VBG O
the DT O
site NN O
in IN O
widely RB O
spaced VBN O
traverses NNS O
, , O
typically RB O
10m CD O
apart RB O

The DT O
instrument NN O

is VBZ O
not RB O
used VBN O
and CC O
there EX O
is VBZ O
therefore RB O
no DT O

Once RB O
anomalous JJ O

are VBP O
identified VBN O
they PRP O
are VBP O
marked VBN O

with IN O
bamboo JJ O

and CC O
approximately RB O
located VBN O
on IN O

The DT O
disadvantages NNS O
of IN O
magnetic JJ O
scanning NN O
are VBP O
that IN O
features NNS O
that WDT O
produce VBP O
weak JJ O
anomalies NNS O
( ( O
less JJR O

2nT CD O
) ) O
are VBP O
unlikely JJ O
to TO O
stand VB O
out RP O
from IN O
the DT O
magnetic JJ O
background NN O
and CC O
so RB O
will MD O
be VB O
difficult JJ O
to TO O
identify VB O

The DT O
relatively RB O
coarse JJ O
sampling VBG O
interval NN O
also RB O
means VBZ O
that IN O
discrete JJ O

or CC O
linear JJ O
features NNS O
that WDT O
are VBP O
parallel JJ O
or CC O
broadly RB O
oblique JJ O
to TO O
the DT O
direction NN O
of IN O
traverse NN O
, , O
may MD O
not RB O
be VB O
detected VBN O

The DT O
drawbacks NNS O
mentioned VBN O
above IN O
mean NN O
that IN O
` `` O
negative JJ O

results NNS O
from IN O
magnetic JJ O

should MD O
always RB O
be VB O
checked VBN O
by IN O

2.4 CD O
The DT O
second JJ O
and CC O

These DT O
